# Optimizing Functions with Natural Algorithms

This benchmark evaluate some natural algorithms for optimization task.

The following algorithms were implemented and tested:
- PSO
- BBPSO
- GA
- CMA-ES

# Functions
- Ackley
- Rosenbrock
- Rastrigin 
- Schwefel
- Griewank

# Results

The tests were evaluated with the following parameters:
- **Number of executions** = 50
- **Population size** = 100
- **Number of epochs** = 100
